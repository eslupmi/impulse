# Versioning

IMPulse uses version numbers like **`v1.0.2`** where:

- **`1`** is a major version. It increases only when user **should** do manual operations to update
- **`0`** is a minor version. It increases when new features / many changes are added
- **`2`** is a bugfix. It increases when code changes minimally
